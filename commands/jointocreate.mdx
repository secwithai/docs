## jointocreate

Setup automatic voice channel creation on join.

**Syntax:** `jointocreate <subcommand>`  
**Aliases:** `jtc`, `j2c`  
**Premium:** Pro

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Syntax | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| setup | `jointocreate setup` | `jointocreate setup` |
| view | `jointocreate view` | `jointocreate view` |
| reset | `jointocreate reset` | `jointocreate reset` |

### How it works

When you run `jointocreate setup`, the bot creates a special voice channel. When a member joins that channel, the bot automatically creates a new temporary voice channel for them. When they leave, the empty channel is deleted.
